## Using Synths

### Playing/Triggering
- Play a simple 4-note melody with the lead
- Trigger pad on chord changes every 4 bars
- Arpeggiate the current chord up and down
- Play lead notes on off-beats only

### Patterns/Sequences
- Create a rising 8-note sequence
- Add call-and-response between lead and bass
- Play melody with probability-based note skips
- Sequence pad stabs on beats 2 and 4

### Modulation/Expression
- Slowly open the lead filter over 8 bars
- Add pitch bend to lead phrases
- Swell pad volume in and out
- Humanize timing with slight randomness

### Interaction
- Make lead follow the drum rhythm
- Sync arpeggiator to kick pattern
- Double the bass melody an octave up
- Fill gaps in drums with lead stabs

### Arrangement
- Mute lead for 4 bars then bring back
- Fade in pad during breakdown
- Drop to just lead and vinyl
- Layer lead with octave harmony

### Generative
- Generate random melody in A major scale
- Create evolving pattern that shifts each bar
- Randomize note lengths within phrase
- Pick notes from chord tones only
